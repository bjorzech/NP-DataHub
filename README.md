# NP-DataHub
Data Visualization/ML Platform that Assesses Nonprofits and Sector-Based Ecosystems

OVERVIEW

Even though there are databases that cater to donors and monitor baseline financial activity for nonprofits based on documents, there is no one resource that allows the end-user to visualize fiscal performance and examine longitudinal data for each nonprofit and an entire non-profit sector, of which there are 26 as defined by the IRS. There also isn’t a sector-based platform that can produce prescriptive and predictive forecasting through algorithmic construction and other ML/AI capabilities.

Based on public IRS data, culled over eight years, we will build a platform allowing the end-user to visualize non-profit fiscal performance to help inform grantmakers, donors, and public policymakers make more accurate and efficient decisions. Essentially, this platform will be similar to the Bloomberg terminal but for nonprofits. This will be accomplished by combining public data solutions and including predictive insights and potential AI functionality. Algorithms are already created and will eventually be integrated.

Often, people search for one charity or non-profit. We want to map the ecosystems by sectors (NTEE codes - sector – and subcodes - purpose) and geography or regions while mapping the connectivity to enhance fiscal strategy. Full list below.

There are 10 major groups, 26 groups (easiest to search), and 645 common subcodes. We want to organize first by these codes, then geography. It’s how people search. Then, we can apply the visualizations and algorithms for next level analysis.

In short, the tentatively named NP DataHub is a cloud-based data intelligence platform for philanthropies and nonprofits that offers algorithmic-based insights for more strategic community investment. 

Often, nonprofits have little direction in collaborating with other organizations with similar missions based on a data-specific composition and geography. Grant-making foundations have a similar problem. Both also have few pathways to combine resources through donor engagement to holistically fund or approach a societal problem, of which public data addressing these problems is more readily and publicly accessible.

PROJECT TIMELINE

The project is designed to be three-month explorations and production can be remote. Virtual project meetings (no more than 45 minutes) will occur once a week with a defined agenda and three key deliverable checkpoints:

Process Requirements

The desired deployment focuses on the development of a web-based browser application. The most universal programming solution appears to be the most intuitive and appropriate for this project and given the data-base structure and emphasis on data intelligence gathering, this is important for current and future developments as expected iterations of this language must be compatible for upgrade purposes. The project client defers to the developers to establish this framework. 

LIMITATIONS

The primary challenge is more so aesthetic as data visualization solutions often reproduce in a cumbersome fashion on some browsers. A second limitation is also identifying a Javascript-based or other UI that will offer the strongest results while also reproducing in a mobile format. Some options have been identified, but an open discussion is very much welcomed. The last limitation may be the identification of reputable data sources to connect data gathered on certain issues that can connect to the NTEE sector for algorithmic construction and insight. Before this step is taken, a larger discussion is needed about the connectivity of the public data set, the availability of data, and how this may connect to the fiscal performance data of individual nonprofits and their NTEE sector.
